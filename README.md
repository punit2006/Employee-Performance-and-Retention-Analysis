# Employee-Performance-and-Retention-Analysis

Objective
This project aims to develop an Employee Performance and Retention Analysis using a real-world dataset. The goal is to apply concepts from probability, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning to analyze employee data and predict performance and retention trends. 

Libraries Required
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / Keras

Project Phases
The project is divided into four phases, which guide you through data collection, analysis, prediction, and reporting.

Phase 1 - Data Collection and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Step 1 - Data Collection and Preprocessing
Dataset - Use a sample employee dataset. The dataset should contain features such as:
Employee ID
Name
Age
Department
Salary
Years at Company
Performance Score
Attrition (Yes/No)
Tasks -
Load the dataset (Employee_data.csv)  using Pandas.
Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and clean inconsistent data entries.

Step 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective - Perform an initial analysis to understand the dataset and its key trends.

Tasks -

Calculate descriptive statistics like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize:
Pairplot to explore relationships between multiple features.
Heatmap for correlation analysis.
Identify any outliers in numerical features (using boxplots).

Step 3 - Probability and Statistical Analysis
Objective - Apply probability concepts and statistical tests to better understand the dataset.

Tasks -

Probability - Calculate the probability of an employee leaving based on factors like performance scores and department.
Bayes' Theorem - Use Bayes' Theorem to find the probability of employee attrition given performance score.
Hypothesis Testing - Test whether the mean performance score differs across departments.

Phase 2 - Predictive Modeling

Step 4 - Feature Engineering and Encoding
Objective - Prepare the data for machine learning models.

Tasks -

Scale numerical features such as Salary and Performance Scores using Min-Max Scaling or Standardization.
Apply Label Encoding to categorical features (e.g., Attrition, Department).

Step 5 - Employee Attrition Prediction Model
Objective - Build a machine learning model to predict employee attrition (i.e., whether an employee will leave or stay).

Tasks -

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn.
Choose a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier).
Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the confusion matrix to check the model’s performance.

Step 6 - Employee Performance Prediction Model
Objective - Build a regression model to predict employee performance based on various features.

Tasks -

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Build a Linear Regression model to predict Performance Score.
Evaluate the model using R-squared (R²) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualize predicted vs. actual performance scores.

Phase 3 - Deep Learning Models

Step 7 - Deep Learning for Employee Performance Prediction
Objective - Apply deep learning techniques to predict employee performance using neural networks.

Tasks -

Prepare the dataset for use with TensorFlow or Keras.
Build a feedforward neural network:
Input layer - Employee features like Age, Salary, Department.
Hidden layers - Dense layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU).
Output layer - Predicted Performance Score.
Train the model using Mean Squared Error as the loss function.
Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

Step 8 - Employee Attrition Analysis with Deep Learning
Objective - Use deep learning for classification to predict employee attrition based on various features.

Tasks -

Build a neural network model with input features like Age, Department, Performance Score, etc.
Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Phase 4 - Reporting and Insights

Step 9 - Insights and Recommendations
Objective - Derive actionable insights based on your analysis and predictions.

Tasks -

Summarize key findings, such as:
Key factors contributing to employee performance.
High-risk departments or employee groups for attrition.
Recommend strategies to improve retention, such as:
Department-wise performance improvement plans.
Targeted employee engagement programs.

Step 10 - Data Visualization and Reporting
Objective - Present the findings in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner.

Tasks -

Generate interactive data visualizations such as:
Line Plots to show performance trends.
Bar Charts for department-wise attrition.
Scatter Plots for salary vs. performance.
Prepare a detailed project report summarizing:
The analysis and insights derived.
Model evaluation and predictive capabilities.
Visualizations and recommendations.
